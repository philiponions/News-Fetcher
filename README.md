### What's this about?
This is a website which lets you search for news given a specific topic via the News API. The API searches across websites for articles and breaking news headlines from news sources and blogs.
### How did I make this?
I used HTML CSS and vanilla Javascript for the layout.
In terms of the API itself, I used News API which provides json files of news articles.
### Why did I make this?
After making an app for a school project, I fell in love with it and wanted to explore other areas of software development. I chose web development because its the most
popular and documented form of development. There are many different ways to develop a website, and I decided to start with the absolute fundementals, HTML CSS and Javascript.
I did not use any frameworks whatsoever. This project was a great start in getting into web development.

## Instructions
I tried deploying it on firebase, but the API does not accept requests on the browser and can only be done on a localhost. So in order to run the app, you must run it locally. Open index.html with liveserver.
